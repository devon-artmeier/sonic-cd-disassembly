# Sonic CD Disassembly

**NOTICE**: This disassembly is currently being totally refactored, and thus is far from complete. Go here for [the old version](https://github.com/DevsArchive/sonic-cd-disassembly), which can be built.

## Requirements

* [vasm](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/) (M68k CPU, Motorola syntax)
* [vlink](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vlink/)
* [extract-asm-symbols](https://github.com/devon-artmeier/extract-asm-symbols)
* make

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to flamewing and TheStoneBanana for helping out and contributing, especially for R11A in the disassembly's infancy stages back in 2015.
